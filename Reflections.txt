How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Easily view the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Fix bugs or restore code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    More control in Git, but Google docs is safer because it's automatic

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In coding and applications, etc', files are usually related to one another in a project, unlike text files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log to find changes and versions, diff to find the changes made in each one

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Know that you can return to a previous working version even if you created a problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Creating more complex projects like an app.
